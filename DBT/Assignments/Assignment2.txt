1)	Which field of the Customers table is the primary key? 
-> Answer: CNUM  
   Reason:- A primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. 
   In the CUSTOMERS table, the CNUM field is the primary key because each customer has a unique number in that column.

-> Answer: RATING  
   Reason: The columns in the CUSTOMERS table are:  
   1. CNUM  
   2. CNAME  
   3. CITY  
   4. RATING  
   So, the fourth column is RATING.


3) What is another word for row? For column? 
-> Another word for row is "record," and another word for column is "field."


4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table? 
-> In a DBMS , data us stored inside a file.Inside a file, rows are stored sequentially.In DBMS, there is concept of row numbering.
   In RDBMS, table is not a file. Every row is the file.In RDBMS, rows of the table are not stored sequentially, they are not stored in any specific order.
   Rows of the table are scattered (fragmented) all over the DB Server HD.
